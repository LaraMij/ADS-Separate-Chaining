# ADS-Separate-Chaining
This project implements a separate chaining algorithm in C++ as part of my Algorithms and Data Structures class. Separate chaining is a technique used in hash tables to handle collisions by maintaining a list of all elements that hash to the same value.
Features
Efficient Collision Handling: Uses linked lists to handle collisions, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.
Custom Hash Function: Implements a custom hash function to distribute keys evenly.
Basic Operations: Supports insertion, deletion, and search operations.
